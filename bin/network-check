#  This script checks network connectivity and DNS resolution.

#  To mak it platform neutral and avoid dependency on additional tools,
#  DNS is tested by pinging a host.
#
#  Exit codes:
#   0 - Connected to the Internet with DNS resolution working
#   1 - Not connected to the Internet
#   2 - Connected to the Internet, but DNS resolution is not working
#   3 - Other error, see msg
#

#  Set to false if the preference is not to use any Google service :)
